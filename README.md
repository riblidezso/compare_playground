###Notebook pulling test
- Cells has to played before widget works!
- The one without widgets (v2) works
	- the output cell formatting is ugly! It should be just as wide as the input cell. I don!t know yet how to change it.

###Other tests
- See the notebooks for more detailed explanation
- They were created elsewhere so they might not work here  (ETE2 for sure not)

###CGE Outbreak Map
- Integration of the cge outbreak map in ipython notebook, with user created data
- see http://dkrib.web.elte.hu/compare/compare.html for details
